```

**`subscriptions.delete({ subscription_id: Number })`** - Deactivates subscription(s) for the provided subscription ID and application for all activities. After deactivation, all events for the requesting subscription_id will no longer be sent to the webhook URL.

```js
const response = await XRPayments.subscriptions.delete({
  subscription_id: 34070368
});
```
